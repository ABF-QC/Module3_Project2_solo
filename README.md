# NLP and Clustering of Board Games and their Reviews 

### Objective

1. Retrieve a dataset through an API.

2. Apply a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model on the dataset.

3. Use a clustering model to group the data.

4. Analyze the resulting clusters.

5. Draw conclusions based on the interpretation of the clusters.

### Data source

Board games reviews and information will be retrieved from the website https://boardgamegeek.com/ from an [API](https://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi) .
</br></br>
Here is the various information retrieved with the API:

| Game information retrieved      | 
|---------------|
| **Username** |
| **Rating** |
| **Comment**|
| **Game Name** | 
| **Mechanics** | 
| **Min Players** | 
| **Max Players** | 
| **Min Playtime** | 
| **Max Playtime** | 
| **Age** | 
| **Average Rating** | 
| **Wanting Count** | 
| **Wishing Count** | 
| **Description** | 
| **Categories** | 

</br></br>
The retrieved data can be found here [Dataset](data/games_comments.csv)

### Step 1: Data Cleaning,

Data cleaning is crucial for data analysis. The cleaned data can be found here [Cleaned Dataset](data/games_comments_clean.csv)

1. Missing values will be replaced or discarded.
2. A language column will be created based on the language used for the comment.
</br></br>

### Step 2 : Data Analysis

Data Analysis is necessary to understand 
   - the dataset
   - the various trends
   - the distribution
   - the range
     
of the various information available in the dataset.

### Step 3 : NLP - BERT Sentiment

A NLP model, most precisely BERT - Sentiment, will be used to convert the comments to a rating score from 1 to 10.
</br></br>
The new produce Sentiment rating will be useful, since 25% of users did not provide a rating along with their comment.
</br></br>
Some other NLP were tested as well
  - NLP Summarization model (BERT Summarizer)
  - NLP Summarization model (BART Summarizer)
  - NLP keywords model (KeyBERT Sentence Transformer)

However, due to a lack of time no further investigation was done on those three additional NLP.
</br></br>
The data with the added Sentiment rating can be found here [Dataset with Sentiment](data/games_comments_sentiment_summarized.csv) 

</br></br>
Here is an overview of the performance of the BERT Sentiment NLP in comparison to the available ratings.

Here is an overview of the distribution of the BERT Sentiment NLP in comparison to the available ratings.

What might explain the overall poor performance of the BERT Sentiment NLP is that the usual rating is from 1 to 5. However, the rating of the board game site range from 1 to 10. Therefore, we are not comparing apples with apples here.

### Step 4 : Clustering with KMeans

To simplify the clustering model and get a minimal amount of clusters to analyze, we only used the numerical columns of the dataset.
</br></br>
Here are the columns that were used with the KMeans model.

| Column       |
|--------------- |
| max_players    |
| minplaytime    |
| maxplaytime    |
| age            |
| ratings_avg    |
| count_wanting  |
| count_wishing  |
| Sentiment      |

</br></br>
Here is the Elbow Analysis perform on the dataset, to find the right K values. 

![](graph/ElbowKmeans.png)
</br></br>
The KMeans model was used with a K value of eight. Thus, returning 8 clusters for our dataset to analyze further. 
</br></br>
Here is the distribution of the 8 clusters.

### Results

The most revealing and distinguishing features for each cluster were:

  - The audience's age
  - The play time
  - The average rating
  - The popularity (wishing count and wanting count)
    
</br></br>
Here is our interpretation of each cluster:

| Cluster | Interpretation for Games| Cluster | Interpretation for Games|
| :---------: |----------------| :---------: |----------------|
| 0       | - Pre-teens</br>- Short play time</br>- Low to high ratings</br>- Average popularity               | 4       | - Teens & Adults</br>- Short to long play time</br>- High ratings</br>- Average popularity                |
| 1       | - Teens & Adults </br>- Moderate play time</br>- Moderate ratings</br>- Low popularity                | 5       | - Teens & Adults</br>- Long play time</br>- High ratings</br>- Highest popularity                 |
| 2       | - Pre-teens</br>- Moderate play time</br>- Moderate ratings</br>- High popularity                | 6       | - Mid-Teens & Adults</br>- Longest play time</br>- Highest ratings</br>- Low popularity                |
| 3       | - Kids</br>- Very short play time</br>- Low ratings</br>- Unpopular                | 7       | - Teens & Adults</br>- Moderate play time</br>- Low to high ratings</br>- Lowest popularity                |

</br></br>
Principal Component Analysis was used to reduce our dataset to 2 dimension for visualisation.

As indicated on the graph, the cluster can be used to generalize a game audience's age and its popularity.
